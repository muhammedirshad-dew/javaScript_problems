///JAVASCRIPT BIND() METHOD--

///With the bind() method, an object can borrow a method from another object.

//The example below creates 2 objects (person and member).

//The member object borrows the fullname method from the person object:

const person = {
  fullName: function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  },
};

const member = {
  firstName: "karthika",
  lastName: "nikhila",
};

let hello = person.fullName.bind(member);

console.log(hello()); // karthika nikhila

//The let hello statement defines a variable that will hold a function (created by bind()).
//This function is a copy of the fullName property,
// but it will be bound to the member object when it is called.

// Key Differences:
// call(): Immediately invokes the function with arguments passed individually.
// apply(): Immediately invokes the function with arguments passed as an array.
// bind(): Returns a new function that, when invoked later, has the specified this value and optionally predefined arguments.
